34729059	69984	why isn't  self closing?. i've been wondering why none of the revisions to the html specification have ever made textarea able to be self-closing. lot's of so questions have answered why it is a separate tag from input, and it makes sense to me that they'd want to preserve it as a separate tag for compatibility, but why wouldn't they make &lt;textarea /&gt; just as valid as &lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; since this wouldn't break anything as far as i can tell.

34465008	86014	methods of finding unknown object properties. some of the incoming objects i handle in my projects have unknown structures; properties i cannot depend on. i decided to try to build a function to help.  my question is, is there a better way of getting all the properties of an object with unknown structure? a mini-question also is; could the regex be improved? this is assuming the object is one level deep. i figure, after getting the keys, one could iterate through them to find other objects and therefore other keys.

35687732	111111	how does this module pattern in javascript work?. i am learning about module patterns, a bit confused about how they behave. so, i have this simple module,   from what i have understood till now(and please correct me if i am wrong), the above function will be invoked immediately(because of the parentheses).  when it runs, it returns an object, which contains only the public methods defined.  so, in the end, after executing the above function our code will look something like this internally (please, please correct me if i am wrong. this is only my understanding of its behaviour)  the thing which i don't understand is, when we access the public methods as testmodule.incrementcounter() or testmodule.resetcounter(), how do they get the value of the counter, as testmodule now doesn't have counter?  i can see it gets the value for the first time, as when that anonymous function was self invoked, it did increment counter and reset the values. but what about second time, from where it gets the value of counter? i hope i am clear. thanks in advance.

30061775	122704	fastest way to clone an object?. i'm aware of $.extend, which does almost what i need, but it also seems to 'unwrap' the prototype, by copying over all the methods as members of the new object. is there any way to tell it to skip inherited members, or do i have to roll my own copy function? here's what i currently have, but i'm not sure if it can be improved upon:  update: looking at $.extend implementation, it seems very similar to what i have, except for hasownproperty check, so perhaps this is the best way to do it after all?

28240670	171256	how to copy functions from one object to another?. i'm working with a home-grown javascript library that has event handling. at it's core is a registerevents function:  in this, mod is a module, moduledata is an array of modules that is in the functions parent scope, and evts is an object with named functions. use is something like:  this is all working well, except that it requires all the events to be registered at once, there's no ability to register an additional event, later. what i would like is to extend this so that when you call registerevents(), if there are no events registered you accept the passed evts object as your events object, but if there are already events registered, then you add the functions in your evts object to your events object. something like this:  and i haven't a clue as to how to do it. one complexity: our new function, evts.event1, was defined in a particular lexical scope. when we move the function to another object, we don't want to change that scope. the variables that were in the parent scope when evts.event1 was defined should remain accessible to evts.event1, even after it's been moved to another object. i'm at a loss. help would be appreciated.

(outside of one being an expression and the other being a declaration) for example, the expression obviously generates a new function everytime the constructor gets called. does this happen with the function declaration aswell, or does it only get evaluated once because function declarations are evaluated at parse time? (as opposed to function expressions which are evaluated at execution time, you get the idea.) edit: i'm aware that javascript doesn't really have private methods. i'm using the the term loosely. edit: not a duplicate of var functionname = function() {} vs function functionname() {}, if anything a duplicate of function expression vs function declaration with regard to javascript 'classes'. my question isn't about the difference between function expressions and function declarations in general, but their differences specifically in regards to ""private members"" in javascript ""classes""."

34498221	750506	"variable in generated javascript function doesn't behave as expected. i'm having some issues with scoping in javascript when generating a function from within a loop.  what i want: the way i want this to work is a for loop that for each iteration, generates a function named dostuff + i. for example, the first iteration will generate dostuff1() the second will generate dostuff2() and so on and so forth. the functions themselves (for the sake of example) just need to print out i&mdash;that is, dostuff1() prints 1, dostuff2() prints 2, etc. what i get: what's actually happening, is i doesn't 'stick' in the function. it becomes part of the global scope or something so it's 10 for every function. you can see this if you click the first button in the snippet below. what i've tried: using a generator function in example two, i've tried using the function* notation to create a proper function generator. i'm pretty sure i implemented it before, but i've never used that notation before so i could be way off. please let me know if that's the case. the result of this is the same as example 2. using a string instead of an integer for example three, i decided to try using a string instead of an integer and it works! for every iteration, a is appended to a string so when i run the generated functions in order, i get a nice little pyramid of the letter a. declaring and assigning variables in a different place since i had to define the stringout variable in a different scope in example 3, i decided to try the same with numbers for example 4, and it worked again! this doesn't make much sense to me since being in a higher scope seems like it would be more likely to suffer from the same problems as example 1 &amp; 2. what i want to know:  how come examples 3 &amp; 4 work, while 1 &amp; 2 don't? edit: my code was broken. none of it works. did i use the function* generator declaration properly? what is the best (most simple, concise, and readable) way to do this? i know making an array of functions would probably be best, but in this situation that isn't possible.  example code:   function test1() { document.getelementbyid(""output"").innerhtml = ""#1 output:""; var myfunctions = []; for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { myfunctions[i] = function() { document.getelementbyid(""output"").innerhtml += ""&lt;br&gt;"" + i; } } for (var j = 0; j &lt; 10; j++) { myfunctions[j](); } } function test2() { document.getelementbyid(""output"").innerhtml = ""#2 output:""; window.test2funcs = {}; function* generator() { var functionname = ""dostuff""; var number = 0; while (number &lt; 10) { number++; yield { myfunction: function() { document.getelementbyid(""output"").innerhtml += ""&lt;br&gt;"" + number; }, name: functionname + (number) } } } var generator = new generator(); for (var k = 0; k &lt; 10; k++) { var out = generator.next().value; window.test2funcs[out.name] = out.myfunction; } for (var l = 1; l &lt; 11; l++) { func = ""dostuff"" + l; test2funcs[func](); } } function test3() { document.getelementbyid(""output"").innerhtml = ""#3 output:""; var myfunctions = []; var stringout = """"; for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { stringout += ""a""; // edit. moved from within function below. myfunctions[i] = function() { document.getelementbyid(""output"").innerhtml += ""&lt;br&gt;"" + stringout; } } for (var j = 0; j &lt; 10; j++) { myfunctions[j](); } } function test4() { document.getelementbyid(""output"").innerhtml = ""#4 output:""; var myfunctions = []; var numout = 0; // edit. used to be "

34600335	750506	javascript/jquery post request seems to pass, but isn't executing as expected. i have a python flask server running and it is serving up csv files to the client on request via a 'post' request. this part of the project is working perfectly. on the client, one portion of my script is to take the csv file and add it to a graph. this task is not complete yet, but i'm getting there. when i started, i decided to plot one piece of data from one section of code. now that i'm expanding to plotting multiple pieces of data, i'm finding some sort of issue that i don't understand. the 'csvfilelist' array holds integer numbers which correspond to different node numbers that have data to plot. data to be plotted is contained in the 'plotdata' array. you can see in the for loop within the post request that data is being saved there. the 'rawdata' is intended to be a dictionary with keys that correspond to the values within 'csvfilelist'. the values will be two-dimensional arrays. eventually, 'rawdata' will be assembled into 'plotdata'.  now that i have the background out of the way, i can give you my observations. when i plot 'plotdata', i can look at the plot and see that all three csv files that i'm processing are sending data into the 'plotdata' array. however, when i'm adding the 'rawdata' object, nothing is happening on csv files 1 and 2, only on 3. this is very strange since i can see that data is being plotted from all three files. when i place a breakpoint within the 'function(data)' of the '$.post' request, it only stops when 'nodenum' is 3 (which is the last one). so, just to reiterate, i see that data is plotted for nodes 1, 2, and 3, but it appears that 'function(data)' is only being executed on nodenum = 3. this behavior doesn't make sense.

24869292	5100287	facebook sdk/api getting in touch with page likers / fans. we are looking to develop a facebook app for a client of ours - this subject seems to be a huge discussion as to what information an app can access. we just needed to find out for certain what we can and can't do from someone who has maybe been here before. if you have a page with 10,000 likes, we've pretty much come to the conclusion that facebook will not let you create an app to allow sending messages to these people who have liked the page - is this correct? we want a way to communicate with these people! we saw that there is a way to send a 'notification' via an app (which isn't ideal as we'd have to build the 10,000 users all over again), and wasn't sure whether this had any restrictions either (i.e. whether it is just for games or whether the wording is limited etc).  in a nutshell, does anyone know whether it would be possible to create a facebook app, which isn't a game, to create a way of messaging the users who have liked a page? or at least an app which we can try to turn the page likes into app authorisation and connect with them that way?

35708808	6847754	why is a value not assigned in node.js before the next command?. i am currently working on a project and for a small part of that i use node.js on my raspberry pi 2. my problem is: i want to get the state of a gpio pin in order to transfer this state via http response but it doesn't always work (further explanation below the code). to make it short this is how the necessary code looks like:  my problem is that when i change the state of the gpio pin and then request the state (via http from another device) the console.log in the function checkstate1 will print out the right value (e.g. 'true) but the console.log('global it is: ' + stateglobal) will return the old value (e.g. 'false'). only when i request it another time both values will be correct. my guess is that it has something to do with node.js asynchronous nature so that the commands, after checkstate1 is called, are not waiting for it to be finished. could that be true? and if so how would i manage that? thank you veeery much in advance.

34280488	14220323	why does this function assignment return nothing?. i have a function, that calls a function. the child function makes an api call so i use a callback function to return the child functions value. after the call to the child function(but still in the parent function), i'm trying to use the value that child function returns. here is the child function and the way i call the function:  and the function call:  when i console.log storyimage inside of the function it returns the proper value, so i'm assuming the proper value is also being returned. but if i console.log tempimage it comes back as undefined? also when i try to use tempimage (trying to append it with jquery to an element in the dom) nothing shows up. i've tested the value being returned, and when i insert it manually into the dom it works. i'm still learning js but i know the api call is happening asynchronously, right? so the log happens before the call gets the info and returns it. but how do i prevent this from happening? how can i use the data being returns as it is being returned? i've read several of the articles here on stack overflow but haven't found the solution. i have read how do i return the response from an asynchronous call? which is where i learned i needed to use a callback function, which i am doing now, but i'm still having the issue.

34318388	14220323	accessing return variable declared in callback. so i am going to preface this by saying that my understanding of callback functions is limited so there is a chance i am making a beginner mistake with either callbacks or requirejs. essentially, what i am looking for is the ability to access the values of the method from an api and create a variable by looping through what is contained inside the callback function. i then want to take that variable and return its value in the return portion of my requirejs define statement. below is a simplified example of what i am trying to do.  i appreciate any help i get in advance! thanks! edit: the information on promises is extremely helpful and definitely helps me wrap my head around asynchronous functions in general but i need to return my variable data in a requirejs return statement. there is a downstream program, that i have no control over, expecting data to be returned in a specific format that is provided by the return value of my define function.

35452324	20077854	chrome extension addlistener unable to send response because port is null. have a problem i can bypass but do not understand why it is so! trying to develop a chrome extension and send messages from the popup to the background script - no problem. but in the background listner i am unable to send a response because the port is null just because i call a chrome.storage function first - why? i have this helper function:  that is called in chrome.runtime.onmessage.addlistener  when i debug the sendresponse({result: true}); i can see that the port is null and therefore it fails. i have looked up that this is because people did not close ports and therefore chrome have made it so that ports are closed after the first call. it shall be possible to bypass this by returning true in the prior callback functions. in my case this is a bit complicated as i have to call the callback first before i can return true in getsettings - and this fails. i can just move the sendresponse({result: true}); out before or after the call to getsettings and it works fine. but what if i was depending on some specific settings before i send the response - how do i achieve this? i know i can make a permanent open port, but is the above really by design?

33758753	20279485	jquery overwriting 'this' in prototype. i have declared a javascript object:  as a simple example i have set up a button that if it's clicked should output a variable to the local console log:  the script:  when i click the button i want this.name to show (in this case 'hello'), but instead this refers to the clicked button, and not to the object i created.  this is a debugging script of course. in real life i'm binding a function to the window.resize event which will re-build a window on resizing.  there is a jsfiddle that shows the problem. i have one solution for this, that is declaring the resize (or click function) in the constructor of the object and using an alternative name for this, like so (here's the jsfiddle):  but i'd rather use a prototype and bind the function in the object's constructor. how can i do this using prototypes?
33778764	20279485	why does setting `this.property` in a function in a class make a new property but getting `this.property` uses the class property?. i have a class in javascript with a property (is_initialized) and a function (isinitialized). class definition :  bluetoothle.isinitialized is a function in a cordova plugin (no knowledge of cordova is required for answering this question), it returns an object { isinitialized : true/false } and will pass the first if-statement whilst my call to isinitialized() will execute the else. question : why does this.is_initialized on line 9 create a new property inside the function isinitialized while this.is_initialized on line 14 uses the property is_initialized in test()? shouldn't it both use the property inside test() or use a (new) variable inside isinitialized()? and if it 'just' behaves like this, what can i do to deal with it? code i ran :  what just happened is this:  i made a new instance of test() and named it t. i made an object with matching structure of is_initialized in test() but with a different value. i called the function with r as parameter. code in the else executes. asynchronous function with isinitialized as callback is called. the function created a reference between the existing is_initialized and r. the async function calls isinitialized and executes the code in the if. it logs the current value of this.is_initialized on line 8, somehow it gets this.is_initialized after line 9 is executed. line 9 executes, creating a new variable named is_initialized inside isinitialized() while i want it to set is_initialized in test() and not create a new variable that dies when the function is done executing. it logs the object that was put into this.is_initialized.obj.isinitialized. i log r and see that it contains the initial value of test.is_initialized. i log t and see that is_initialized's value is still initial.  info : if you want to test it yourself to answer my question of the why? and the how do i deal with it? but need some code for bluetoothle.isinitialized just use this:  i would like to thank you for reading this long question.

34090463	20279485	scope with javascript callback function. i have an html page that references 2 javascript files x.js and y.js. in y.js i request some data from a web service. when i receive the data i would like to call any methods that have registered an interest in the data. i added a registercallback function to y.js and from x.js i call the function and pass it a function for the callback, which gets added to an array. when the data is received from the web service a for loop calls all of the callback functions which have previously been registered. this works and the callback function in x.js gets called. however a variable that was initialised in x.js is undefined when the callback function gets called. it appears that the callback function that gets called in x.js is not the same x.js that was passed when the callback was registered. (if that makes sense) in the example below the variable svgimage gets initialised but when the callback happens it is undefined. x.js  y.js  if i call getparameterdata from x.js and pass the callback function instead of registering and storing it in the array it works fine. how can i overcome this problem?

35316125	20279485	calling a named function in a callback. i'm new to js and the script i'm writing requires that i use ajax to retrieve json data from an api. this means i'm having to get my head around callbacks etc. my objective with the simplified below code is to invoke a function (methoda) which then invokes methodb, which calls methodc on completion. for some reason, methodc fails to activate and i have no idea why. see fiddle for live example:  (i know that i could probably use jquery's deferred when().then() pattern, or es6 promises, but as a learning exercise i'm trying to get my head around the barebones way to do it.)

33560401	22519785	how do i use promises with a callback-based api wrapper function in node.js?. currently i am building a web application using node and express. the application is required to access another api and push that data to the user. i wrote the api wrapper using the request library. an example api function looks like this:  oftentimes it is necessary to push this data to a view. i do this by using express routes; however, it is oftentimes necessary to make multiple function calls to retrieve all of the information i need. this creates a situation familiar to us as callback-hell:  not only is this horrible to read, but it also makes the code more difficult to extend if i want to pass another piece of the data to the view. after some research, i've seen that the best methods of solving this are with promises and generators. i'm aware that the proper solution to this may be using generators, but i think i need a more solid understanding of promises before i attempt to implement one. i looked into using the q promise library for node, however, i found that q.fcall only works when the function returns a value, which, in this case, it doesn't. the q library documentation mentions two concepts, deferreds and q.promises, that i think could be helpful, but i don't understand how to implement either of these things. so my question is, how can i either rewrite the api function to return a promise, or how can i rewrite the code to call the function and retrieve the data using promises?

35173478	23667087	beginner problems with scope in javascript. i have a feeling that this is a very basic error, but i've spent a couple of days reading articles/books about scope in javascript, returning to this problem, and still not really achieving any clarity, let alone a working solution – so its time to throw myself upon your mercy. i've looked at the other questions/answers, of course, but they seem to be referring to different kinds of scope problems, or at least studying them hasn't brought me any closer to a solution, so i though i'd risk asking for myself. this function is supposed to take a list of filenames, then iterate over the list retrieving the files themselves and passing the contents to another function, which itself returns a javascript object representing the file content. as noted in the comments, this method itself works – when articles[i] is created inside the loop, articles[i].body contains exactly the data it should. but, by the time the loop is finished, somehow the array is empty again. is anyone able to tell me what i've done wrong?

30793127	28250697	how to construct a promise chain involving multiple dependence?. i want to construct a promise chain as below. the arrows represent dependence: b needs the output of a; c needs the outputs of both a and b.  since it is not simply a chain but is a net, i don't know how to do it in an elegant way. my idea is to let the output of b contain the output of a, and pass it all together to c through edge (b,c). i guess it's probably not the best way to do it because there should be some method by passing the result of a directly to c.  
30837086	28250697	how to correctly use promises to return 2 different results. i am trying to use promises in javascript using es6 to return data from 2 methods from an object, which would in production call out to an endpoint. my movieapi object i have 2 promises which i want to return firstly a list of movies, and then 1 movie by id. i want to use promises to avoid callback hell. i am following the approach listed as the answer to the question arent promises just callbacks but i am clearly doing it wrong, as i have the error findmovie is not defined  call the movie promise like this... but i get an error trying to call my second .then() method  is there a way to get out of callback hell here, or will i just have to make another call to the movieapi object, essentially having the same readability issue as if i were using callbacks.

31495162	28250697	do you always have to return a promisified object in order to make sure its execution is fulfilled?. let's say you promisify a mysql connection object (in order to make raw mysql queries):  and then, you start a promise chain with some orm method. inside of the first then, you get a color object, returned from the color model, but then, you want to start a mysql transaction and pass that color to the next then in the promise chain (but also ensure that the transaction starts):   i'm thinking that returning con.query ensures that the transaction is started (and the promise chain continues), but is that the only way? i know i could do:  or could also return an array and use spread instead of then:  are these the only ways of doing this? ideally, i'd like something that is very similar to the first example i posted, because i think that returning a new promise looks dirty, and returning an array is kind of confusing, since i don't care about what con.query returns at all. thanks.
