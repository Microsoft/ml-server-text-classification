(otherwise, i would have to run an ajax request for php script which possibly checks the answer from mysql db. that would introduce extra latency and load on the server) now, just to make sure, i would like to make it a bit more difficult for users with low programming skills to find out the answer variable or see the comparing function. is it somehow possible to make a function in javascript non-human readable? or at least making it hard-readable?  just to remind you again, i am not too concerned if the final code will be not secure enough and some people actually crack the compare function and get the answer - i would be happy for their effort.

(the same result as angular.equals) however if a space is added between text, then the check returns false (as expected) so what is the best way to check an object for equality with pinpoint accuracy?  would appreciate if all answers are in raw javascript, and not using external libraries.

(i'll try to keep the question simple for now, since i don't really know how to go about this.) i have to change unordered list elements inside an html file by 1.) create a dom fragment ( for each of the new &lt;li&gt; ) in javascript. 2.) remove the original batch of &lt;li&gt; in the ul. 3.) append each new dom fragment into the ul 4.) make each of the new &lt;li&gt; elements clickable again clicking on a &lt;li&gt; element removes the contents of the ul and replaces it with a new batch (the batch varies from 0 &lt;li&gt; to 6 &lt;li&gt; elements (depending on which element you clicked)) the first problem i'm having is that there is no way to create multiple elements clickable in one go (for loops doesnt work) so at the moment im just repeating the functions i have.  second, when you remove a li element and put back a new element, you have to make it clickable, but since you dont know the number of elements and for loops dont work, i can't add a function upon creation. not all elements follow the same format also, so simply modifying the existing li isnt an option. is there a simple way that i don't know about that does what i want it to do..?

[first this question may be taking about same concept as how does javascript .prototype work?, but has different context.] i came across this blog which states:  in javascript, each object has a property called “prototype”. an object’s prototype allows us adding properties to all instances of that object (even to the existing instances).  as per my understanding so far, the above statement is confusing for beginners as it does not distinguish between ""prototype"" and ""[[prototype]]"". not all objects have a prototype property, for example:  i think it would be better if we say:  in javascript, each object has an internal property called “[[prototype]]” that can be seen in some browsers by accessing the non-standard property called “__proto__”. an object’s prototype allows us adding properties to all instances of that object (even to the existing instances). only functions (hence constructors) have ‘prototype’ property to set that allows us adding properties to all instances of that object made by that function/constructor.  is this a more accurate description of javascript prototypes, or am i missing something? thanks in advance."

11670722	750506	javascript function within loop / closure. i'm new to javascript and trying to understand the behavior of this code, which attempts to assign unique onclick handlers to different dom elements in the array myelements[]:  my understanding is that each time a dom element is clicked, the browser should alert 'you clicked on 100' as javascript will use the value i has once the function has completed i have two questions:  if i only has scope within the function handleclicks() how can the browser access i once the function has completed - surely i no longer exists? i tried this code by putting two html elements in the array   var myelements = [];    but when the program runs, it alerts 'you clicked on: 2' for each element clicked.  why isn't it alerting 'you clicked on: 100'. as this is surely the value of i once the function has finished running?

17796048	750506	dojo deferred chaining with array overwriting arguments. i am calling a function that saves edits to a database and returns a dojo/deferred. i found that i could not save all records at once and so i limited each call to only send 150 records at a time and simply chained several calls together using a for loop. every time this code runs, the first 150 records are successfully saved and the final batch of records are successfully saved. any batches in between seem to be overwritten by the final batch. here is the code:  adds, updates, and deletes are all array's of object's. my guess is that because array's store references, the references are being overwritten each time through the loop. i tried creating deep copies of the array's before passing them to layer.applyedits, but that had no effect.

18880895	750506	why, when i add a bunch of event listeners in a loop, does every element trigger the last listener added?. on a page, i have an svg map of the us and canada, and an html list of provinces and states. hovering over any province, either its name in the list or its depiction on the map, should make both name and depiction turn a different color. all the names and paths have logical ids/classes on them already. here's a fiddle with my code. (it's a horrible procedural mess at the moment, so please forgive me.) jquery's event functions don't work on svg, and though i know there's a jquery plugin that supposedly helps, i thought this would be a good opportunity to use a larger proportion of vanilla javascript than i'm used to. the most relevant part of the code is the makemapinteractive function on lines 46 through 69 of the javascript:  what i'm trying to tell it to do is to add a mouseover listener to every element, that triggers a change on all elements involved in that element's province. what actually happens is that hovering over anything on the whole page triggers the very last event listener added, the one for wyoming. it's like when i change the $alltargets variable, it changes all the previously-added listeners to the elements contained in its new value. but i can't see how that's happening, since i'm applying the event listeners to the dom elements inside that variable, not the jquery object itself. can someone explain exactly what is going on here? i know i'm using jquery a bit here, but i'd like the answer to use no more than i'm already using; it's my vanilla javascript skill that needs increasing.

19259880	750506	sending a variable to a function expression in javascript?. i will begin by explaining what i am trying to do here with a simple example.   create a local scope variable id and give it a value x. create a function expression where i print out the value x by means of alert(a); and store that function as a variable fn in a global list. modify id to represent the value y. call fn(); through my global list and have x printed out for me.  the problem now is that the value printed by fn() is y and not x as was initially assigned to id. i first found a solution by dealing with temporary global variables, but it simply doesn't work anymore as the project has grown quite a bit. i no longer have the means required to keep track of these global temps. any help to point me in the right direction would be appreciated. i apology if this question has been answered before. perhaps i am just not very good at searching the web, but i have yet to find a satisfying one. note: i should perhaps add that contrary to the amount of times i mentioned the variable scopes, it is not a problem. the local variable seems to somehow be treated globally (or perhaps a global pointer to it is created?) as there is no problem printing a local variable from other scopes when done in the manner described above. here is a code sample of what i want (i decided it would be clearer this way than using my own code):  best regards.

22247446	750506	targetting correct jquery object in 'for' loop. i'm betting this is a fairly 101 javascript question, but for an array of jquery objects (each a div with various content) i'm trying to get some in the sequence triggering an 'onhover' event in a separate, specified object later in the array. the problem is, as the objects are initialised in order, the earlier ones (which should trigger the hover events) don't have 'access' to the later objects because those haven't been created yet.  so, as the objects are created and pushed into the 'sections' array, i check if they are set to trigger a hover event (the details are provided by xml) and, if so, 'push' them into a separate 'onhoversections' array and give them an 'onhover' property which specifies the 'id' of the jquery object it should trigger. objects that are set to be triggered by a hover event listen for the event with...  then, when all of the objects are initialised, i loop through the 'onhoversections' array and check each 'onhover' property against the 'id's of the other jquery objects in the 'sections' array and set up that object to trigger the 'onhover' event, as below:  so the problem now is, at the end of all that, 'loopinner' is at a value that's higher than any of the indexes in the 'sections' array.  how do i add the .trigger listener to the appropriate jquery object in the 'sections' array, using a reference that won't have changed by the time the actual .hover function is called?  thanks for reading all of this!

26935167	750506	for loop not working as expected, what am i doing wrong?. i'm making a form where the user can rsvp for themselves and up to 5 others. each guest has a text field for their names and then radio buttons (yes or no) as to whether they are attending or not. by default guest 1 &amp; 2 are displayed and then there is a button the user can click to add another guest up until guest #6. guest's 3 - 6 are contained in their own objects like this:  i am hiding guest's 3 - 6 using the following function which are then converted to methods for the above objects:  i also have the opposite of the above function in showfields:  so the idea here is that when the add guest button (which is assigned to the variable addguest) is clicked guest #3 will be added. then when it's clicked again guest #4 will be added and so on until #6. i've added the guestthree - guestsix objects to the following array:  and then using the following for loop:  but this doesn't work. i have discovered through testing that guest loops all the way round to 4 without executing the showfields methods. if i was to add a break after the onclick event then guestthree will display but that's it (obviously because that's how break works) but this atleast shows that the loop works as i hoped - to an extent.  so what i am asking of you guys is - what am i doing wrong? how do i make it so that the guest variable doesn't loop straight to 4? i need each iteration to be 0, 1, 2 and finally 3 and as far as i can see that is exactly what should be happening? cheers!

32076630	750506	javascript and closures when it comes to outer variables. i've been reading a book about javascript and the author has been touching the subject of closures for a few pages. on one page, he shows the following example:  now, he says that one might expect f(); to return 10, but it actually returns undefined. here's what he says:  the bug in the program comes from the fact that the programmer apparently expected the function to store the value of i at the time the nested function was created. but in fact, it contains a reference to i. since the value of i changes after each function is created, the inner functions end up seeing the final value of i. [...] since each iteration of the loop increments i until it runs off the end of the array, by the time we actually call one of the closures, it looks up index 5 of the array and returns undefined.  but i just can't get my head around his explanations. i've read again his previous explanations about closures (and think i understand them -- but obviously, it seems like i don't) and i've searched for more information on closures on the internet. i stil can't understand why f(); would return undefined. wouldn't the anonymous function be created and called at each iteration of the loop; and therefore, wouldn't it look up all indexes and not just index 5? or am i misunderstanding something? can anyone help me out? thanks.
32078582	750506	for loop help in javascript?. js code  ok so the code here iterates through html file finding elements by class name and i made a for loop that goes through that. all the elements are displayed on the screen and when one element is clicked i would like to alert the value of the element that was clicked. for example lets say elements are numbers 1-10. they are displayed vertically in page and when user clicks on say number 3 browser should alert in box 3. everything in terms of design/display is working. the problem i have is that when ever i click on any element the last element is always showing. in terms of our number example if user clicks on number 5 last number 10 is showing. if user clicks on any number last number is showing. i believe this is because the whole loop is executing before something is clicked. i am wondering how i can fix this.

3136786	951057	sleep() in javascript. suppose i want to block javascript execution for certain time for some weird reason, how can i do that. there is no sleep() in js. pls don't say do a while() loop because that's bad. i can do a window.showmodaldialog and put a window.close in the modal dialog with settimeout of very small time so that the user doesn't notice the dialog. this will be like sleep for small time period and i can call this multiple time if needed. is there some other way? to elaborate, my use case is that html5 sql database has given async api's but i want to use it for a samll webapp for which the store will never be big. so there is no need of an async api because the queries on the small store will run on the client side. so i want to write an orm with sync api so that developers can use it more easily. to bridge this async to sync api, i need something like sleep.
3845972	951057	what's the best way to implement a sleep function javascript?. i'm aware of both setinterval and settimeout functions but it's not suitable for my case, because i need to create an img dom element in the interval of 7 seconds.  the count of images are not predefined (varies daily).  when i use setinterval, i cannot completely stop it after certain limit (daily count). [clearinterval clears iterations only]  when i use settimeout inside loop (daily count), it never delays. so the only possibility is a sleep function. can anyone help for this situation?  what's the best way to implement a sleep function javascript?  
4634013	951057	"javascript sleep. yes, i know - that question has thousands of answers. please, don't tell me about settimeout method because - yes, everything is possible with that but not so easy as using sleep() method.  for example:  if you know how to get the same result using settimeout - tell me ;) fibanacci is pretty easy task, because there aren't more than 2 recursions, but how about n-recursions (like fib(1) + fib(2) + .. + fib(n)) and sleep after every ""+""? nah, sleep would be muuuuuch easier.  but still i can't get working example of implementing it. while (curr - start &lt; time) { curr = (...) } is tricky, but it won't work (just stops my browser and then throw all console logs at once)."

13998966	1451043	about a loop that creates dynamic buttons, but cannot give proper values.  possible duplicate: javascript infamous loop problem?   i am having a small issue, and it would be very nice if some of you could realize about what kind of logic is missing here, since i cannot seem to find it:  i have an array with the results of some previous operation. let's say that the array is:   and then i have a bunch of code where i create some buttons, and inside a for loop i assign a different function to those buttons, depending on the position of the array. the problem is that for some reason, all the buttons created (two in this case) come out with the function assigned to the last value of the array (in this case, both would come out as one, instead of the first with 0 and the second with 1) this is the code:  as it is, this code produces as many buttons as elements in the array, each with its proper label (it retrieves labels from another array). everything is totally fine. then, i click the button. all the buttons should run the newcard function. that function needs the id variable, so in this case it should be:  first button: runs newcard using variable id with value 0  second button: runs newcard using variable id with value 1  but both buttons run using id as 1... why is that? it might be very simple, or maybe is just that in my timezone is pretty late already :-) anyways, i would appreciate any comment. i am learning a lot around here... thanks! edit to add the definition of newcard:  the function generate will generate some content using id. nothing wrong with it, it generates the content fine, is just that id is always set to the last item in the array.

6739136	1520853	consecutive calls to regexp test fail for pattern with global option. i've been wrestling with this all day, and i can't figure out if i'm doing something wrong or if i've found a bug in chrome's javascript engine. it appears that consecutive calls to a regexp object with the global flag returns inconsistent results for the same input string. i'm testing with the following function:   when i call the function with /a/g as the pattern and various arrays of strings, i get the following results, many of which are incorrect as far as i can tell:  when i call the same function with the same arrays of strings, but pass /a/ as the pattern, the actual results all match the expected results.  i've created a working example of the code above:  am i missing something? shouldn't the results be the same for the given arrays of strings no matter if the pattern is global or not? note, i've primarily been working in chrome, but i've observed similar incorrect results in firefox 4 and ie 8.

1566595	1566644	can i use multiple versions of jquery on the same page?. a project i'm working on requires the use of jquery on customers' web pages. customers will insert a chunk of code that we'll supply which includes a few &lt;script&gt; elements that build a widget in a &lt;script&gt;-created &lt;iframe&gt;. if they aren't already using the latest version of jquery, this will also include (most likely) a &lt;script&gt; for google's hosted version of jquery. the problem is that some customers may already have an older version of jquery installed. while this may work if it's at least a fairly recent version, our code does rely on some recently introduced functionality in the jquery library, so there are bound to be instances when a customer's jquery version is just too old. we can't require that they upgrade to the latest version of jquery. is there any way to load a newer version of jquery to use only within the context of our code, that will not interfere with, or affect, any code on the customer's page? ideally, maybe we could check for the presence of jquery, detect the version, and if it's too old, then somehow load the most recent version just to use for our code. i had the idea of loading jquery in an &lt;iframe&gt; in the customer's domain that also includes our &lt;script&gt;, which seems like it might be feasible, but i'm hoping there's a more elegant way to do it (not to mention without the performance and complexity penalties of extra &lt;iframe&gt;s).

29206756	2631198	accessing nested json element safely. simple javascript / json question. in my code i am finding a value for a variable from one of a number of sources (i try each in turn until i find one that is not undefined). one of those sources is a json object with several levels of elements, not all of which are guaranteed to be populated. say, for example, the data that i need is found at options.levela.levelb.levelc.datathatineed. none of those levels is guaranteed to be set, including even the options variable itself. to avoid runtime errors (trying to access a subelement of 'undefined'), is the only safe way to access datathatineed to do so as follows:  it just seems like a very inelegant way to do it, with the real possibility of bugs (typos etc) slipping in with all of those levels to include. i wonder if there is a better practice to adopt. it's a shame you can't access options.levela.levelb.levelc.datathatineed directly, returning undefined if datathatineed (or any of the higher levels) is undefined, rather than possibly throwing an error. thanks.

6252067	2846298	what are the criteria for automatic semicolon insertion?.  possible duplicate: what are the rules for javascript&#39;s automatic semicolon insertion?   javascript befuddles me with its implicit line termination. it's a very c-like language, except that ending lines in a semi-colon is often optional. so how does it decide when to assume an end-of-line? consider this example:  punching that into an html file and opening it in safari popped up 3. if you stick a semicolon on the end of the first line, it changes to 0. the algorithms and logic are all straightforward; what interests me is by what criteria javascript decided, in this instance, not to assume an end-of-line after the first line. is it that it only waits for an error scenario before assuming an eol? or is there a more definite criteria? i'm very curious. i haven't researched this much; i want to see what the s/o community has to say about it. i always end my lines with semicolons anyway, but i have some js compression code that trips on the semicolon issue from time to time when i inadvertently leave one out. edit ok just to clarify what the actual question is here: can anybody describe, in non-abstract terms, when javascript will and won't automatically insert semi-colons. this is not a duplicate. i'm aware that the rules for autmoatic semicolon insertion are well established and concisely documented. they're also long winded and confusing because they are generally abstract. in my experience, high level programmers don't digest low level documentation as well as simple end results, which is what i'm looking for. if no one is interested, then i'll have a crack at answering myself when i get a chance. in the meantime, please leave the guns in the holsters for a couple of days. thanks.

6666078	3076648	cross-domain iframe dom properties access from parent's javascript. there are already a few similar questions but they tend to cover child-to-parent relationship. i, on the other hand, would like to be able to get some properties of the iframe's dom. i don't want to manipulate anything. i only want to be able to read properties or dom nodes. things like attributes or contents. afaik this is not possible unless i use something like window.postmessage. as reasonable as this solution it's based on event listeners. this requires a listener to be defined inside the iframe and this means changing the iframe's code. i want to avoid that. if you want to make a cross-domain ajax call, you can (if you have access too) set target server's headers to allow that:  this interestingly enough doesn't work for communication with an iframe. so my question stands: (how) can i access cross-domain iframe's dom properties?

3173610	4616273	can a javascript object property refer to another property of the same object?. i recently tried to create an object like this:  my intentions were to improve jquery's selector performance by caching the results of $('#carousel1 .slider') in an object property, and to keep the code concise and relatively dry. however, this didn't work. when the code executed, it threw an exception when trying to parse the value of panes, complaining that carousel was undefined. this makes sense, since i'd assume that carousel isn't fully declared until the assignment statement has been fully executed. however, i'd like to avoid resorting to this:  that's not too much worse, but the carousel object will have several more properties that rely on the values of other properties, so that could quickly become verbose. i tried using this, but to no avail. i may well not have been using it correctly, or that may not be a valid approach anyway. is there a way for properties of an object to refer to other properties of the same object, while that object is still being declared?  based on matthew flaschen and casablanca's answers (thanks, guys!), i think these are the versions of my actual code that i'd end up with, based on each approach:  and  assuming those are both correct (i haven't tested them), it's kind of a tough call. i think i slightly prefer matthew flaschen's approach, since the code is contained to a structure that more closely resembles an object declaration. there's also ultimately only one variable created. however, there's a lot of this in there, which seems repetitive - although that may be just the price to pay.

25495241	5117172	is there a way to create a name of a variable and have this change from a loop?. say that i have a for loop with index i, and i want to have a variable with a name that ends with the character(s) of the index number. therefore, each time for loops, it will create a variable with a unique name. i want this variable to be a global variable, too. and then, i would want to use each of those variables later by calling var name(i) name of index. it would be okay if they were called some other way, too. it could maybe be done with an array, but with this case, i end up with an array of arrays again, and i need a single array. i need to start with an array of arrays, too.  and i cannot simply use the reduce function because i want each of the arrays in my array of arrays to be a separate array.  note that the input array of arrays will be different each time the program runs and sometimes be jagged.

13418669	13418980	javascript: do i need to put this.var for every variable in an object?. in c++, the language i'm most comfortable with, usually one declares an object like this:  calling getbar() works fine (ignoring the fact that bar might be uninitialized). the variable bar within getbar() is in the scope of class foo, so i don't need to say this-&gt;bar unless i really need to make it clear that i'm referring to the class' bar instead of, say, a parameter. now, i'm trying to get started with oop in javascript. so, i look up how to define classes and try the same sort of thing:  and it gives me bar is undefined. changing the bar to this.bar fixes the issue, but doing that for every variable clutters up my code quite a bit. is this necessary for every variable? since i can't find any questions relating to this, it makes me feel like i'm doing something fundamentally wrong.  edit: right, so, from the comments what i'm getting is that this.bar, a property of an object, references something different than bar, a local variable. can someone say why exactly this is, in terms of scoping and objects, and if there's another way to define an object where this isn't necessary?

709876	14220323	jquery ajax call - set variable value on success. i have an application that i am writing that modifies data on a cached object in the server. the modifications are performed through an ajax call that basically updates properties of that object. when the user is done working, i have a basic 'save changes' button that allows them to save the data and flush the cached object. in order to protect the user, i want to warn them if the try to navigate away from the page when modifications have been made to the server object if they have not saved. so, i created a web service method called isinitialized that will return true or false based on whether or not changes have been saved. if they have not been saved, i want to prompt the user and give them a chance to cancel their navigation request. here's my problem - although i have the calls working correctly, i can't seem to get the ajax success call to set the variable value on its callback function. here's the code i have now.  i feel that i might be trying to use the success callback in an inappropriate manner. how do i set a javascript variable on the success callback so that i can decide whether or not the user should be prompted w/ the unsaved changes message? as was just pointed out, i am making an asynchronous call, which means the rest of the code gets called before my method returns. is there a way to use that ajax call, but still catch the window.onunload event?

16942416	14220323	scope of done event in $.ajax. i'm using jquery $.ajax to add elements on-the-fly to my database.  the server-side returns the id of the element recently added, and i want to capture that in my done event block.   /tags/add returns: return new response($tags[0]-&gt;getid(), 200, array('content-type' =&gt; 'text/html')); where response is framework specific.  if i go to the url /tags/add?tagname=123 it will attempt to add that tag to the database if it doesn't exist. if it is succesful, it will return its id.  in the example above, in returns 63 but the done function doesn't seem to be catching that 63 (or whatever the number is) here's the catch.  let's assume the tag dogs doesn't exist: 1) /tags/add?tagname=dogs will add dogs to the database, and will return id 64 2) if i do console.log(data) in the first line inside the done event block, it will log 0 (default id when the tag doesn't exist) 3) if i try to add dogs tag again to the database, /tags/add?tagname=dogs will see that dogs already exists, and will only return its id (64) 4) then console.log(data) kicks in again, and it logs 64 any idea why is that happening?

19008835	14220323	how do i rewrite this function to be asynchronous?. i have a function that pulls images from an api to insert them in an animated scroller. it looks like this (simplified for clarity):  however, the photo urls don't always resolve to valid images, so i run them through the photoexists() function:  if a given photo url returns a status code of 200, then i know the image exists and i insert it into the scroller; otherwise, i skip over it so that i don't insert a broken image. the problem here is that async: false – because this isn't asynchronous, the whole ui locks up until everything completes, which can be a very long time depending on how many photo urls i have to loop through. if i use async: true, however, then the photoexists() function attempts to return the status code before the ajax request itself actually completes – so photoexists(photo) never returns 200, resulting in nothing being added to the scroller. how would i adjust this so that photoexists() can run asynchronously and therefore avoid locking up the ui, but still return the correct status code so i can insert the photos into the scroller properly?

24137197	14220323	javascript - unexpected result checking variable assignment. i am trying to use javascript to validate an input field, specifically checking for duplicate values in a database before writing the value. the user types a new string into the input, then clicks an 'add' button. the script below gets the value from the input, then checks the database for duplicate values before taking further action.  for some reason, which i cannot fathom, the first test of the flag value always returns 'false' after the getjson function. so in the code above, the first 'alert(flag);' call always returns the flag value as false and the second one returns either true or false depending on what is actually assigned to the flag variable in the condition test above it.  if i remove the alert lines the flag value of false is always given to the condition test at the bottom of the script and thus the function always returns that the value is unique.  with the alert lines present, only the first alert call returns the flag value as false and then the subsequent alert call and the following conditional use the value (either true or false) that i expected from the assignment in the conditional above it.  it seems that, after the getjson function, the first test of the flag variable always returns that it is set to false and then all other tests after that return either true or false depending on what is actually assigned to the flag variable in the function. i cannot understand why and there is obviously a logical explanation that is eluding me.  any help or explanation as to this behaviour will be gratefully accepted. many thanks in advance.

26316167	14220323	why can i not select an element loaded with $.get in jquery. i have a series of buttons loaded from a json, which in turn should disappear and append other buttons on click. like so (the first level of buttons is already on the page and reacting properly to other events like hover):  this is the content of the template being loaded:  here's the gettemplate code:  even though it should append the buttons to the #imgbuttons span, it seems as if it cannot select any of the elements in the template just loaded. if i try to append the buttons to another part of the page (say like the left menu, which is not recently loaded) or instead of getting a template i simply clear out the html in the main, the attachment works. so it appears that the issue is how to select elements that have been loaded. any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks to everyone who pointed me in the right direction. in the end i didn't use ajax but deferred.done like so:

29459184	14220323	data sometimes not retrieved from jquery get. narrowed it down to this:  i use this information later so i store it locally, but sometimes it is undefined, other times it's fine. what makes it so unreliable? the problem it seems to have is that colors is sometimes undefined. is there a timing issue with working on the data before it's done being received? ^===edit===^ gonna try and give you all the necessary info without just pasting my whole project. so on pageload of my drinks/find pages, i run a get request to my database to get the drinks details and to populate the page.  from there, the function gets the data:  often, but not always, i will get a typeerror: a is undefined error from jquery, but refreshing a few times eventually gets it to work. here is the route that calls on my database:  i'm not exactly sure what the problem is. there are spaces in some of my queries (going to fix), but this error also happens with single word searches so i don't think that's the cause of the problem. i'm guessing it has something to do with the page trying to work on data that hasn't been received yet. but the work being done is also a callback on $.getjson, so i thought that wouldn't be an issue. if you guys spot anything that would be super appreciated, i can also provide more info if needed, wasn't sure what was relevant. thanks!
29481947	14220323	in javascript push to an array in a function and get the new array back in another function.  i have a little problem for some weeks and didn't find any answer and don't understand how it works. so here is the problem. it's very simple, i created an array var videos = []; and i wanted to push in this array the json response i got in json.php (for the example) $.getjson('json.php', function(data) { $.each(data, function() { videos.push(data); console.log(videos[0]); }); }); for the moment everything goes well. but when i want to use the array in another function later in the code (there is a lot of code) the chrome console tells me [] (which means nothing in my array) at the line of the other function that use the videos array. so i conclude that after the getjson there, the array content is erased. but i want it to be save to use it later. how should i do that ?

29660189	14220323	setting an ajax response as a javascript variable. i’m developing a javascript game and i’m currently trying to get it to load a randomly chosen image from my database before the game is fully initiated.  i’m using an ajax call which uses a php script that selects a random image address from a table in my database and then echos this image address back to the javascript. i want to place this image address into the space after img.src =  to do this i’m trying to turn the ajax response into a variable that i can then place after img.src =, so that every time the game is reloaded, a new ajax call will be made, and a randomly chosen image link will be placed after img.src = (the img.src = is then used by the game).  here is the code i’m trying along with comments:  this isn't currently loading an image into the game (the game initiates but there's a blank space where the image should be located). i think i'm doing things in the wrong order? i think i need to initiate the ajax call, and then place the game's code inside the ajax call's success function. that way a random image will always be defined before the game gets loaded, but i'm not sure exactly how to do that. if the ajax call happens to fail then i'd still like to initiate the game but with a statically defined img src instead, for example: img.src = 'image001.jpg'; i'd really appreciate anyone's advice on the correct way to implement this code. thanks so much in advance!

31205825	14220323	how to return a variable from a $.getjson function. my question is almost identical to this one: how can i return a variable from a $.getjson function there are a number of other duplicates on stack overflow and i've read through them but yet to find a satisfactory answer. i'm aware of the fact $.getjson runs asynchronously, and i've been writing functions like:  which is fine, and lets me for example, write the data straight from a json source into a html document (using the callback to ensure the data has been received before it gets written out). however, this really isn't what i want to do... i want to be able to call getsharepriceatdate() from other parts of my code. for example:  for this i really need $.getjson to run synchronously... i need to be able to create a getsharepriceatdate(date) function that actually functionally does what it says and returns a specific value from a json source, rather than being forced to print to html within the callback. the solution suggested in the question i linked was to rewrite $.getjson() as the function it's shorthand for $.ajax() and set async = false. this is more like what i want, but chrome console gives the following warning:  synchronous xmlhttprequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. for more help, check http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.  in my case, i am just grabbing 1 value, and having tested it in this instance, it really isn't that detrimental in any way i can see... (it just means my code will hang until the json request comes back, but it would have to anyway! asynchronous or otherwise - i still need that data for the calculation). so i thought async = false must not be an issue in this case but the link in the warning above says:  synchronous xmlhttprequest outside of workers is in the process of being removed from the web platform as it has detrimental effects to the end user's experience. (this is a long process that takes many years.) developers must not pass false for the async argument when the javascript global environment is a document environment. user agents are strongly encouraged to warn about such usage in developer tools and may experiment with throwing an invalidaccesserror exception when it occurs.  which seems like it's saying if i use async = false my code won't be future proof. stack overflow is full of people asking how to use $.getjson() and the answers usually tell them to make use of the callback. i'd like to know:  what is the advantage of $.getjson() being asynchronous in this context? how can i access external json data in a function that returns a value from the json? (i.e. how can i have something that lets me call var price = getsharepriceatdate() and have my code wait while price is found)  edit: i already know how to do something like getsharepriceatdate(calculatechangeinvalue); the code i'm writing could really do with being able to print out share prices at given dates quite often, i was hoping for a better way

32730234	14220323	how to wait for async to finish in jquery. there are countless similar threads to this but no canonical ones which seemed to answer my question. there are also many which seem to involve really complicated solutions to what seems should have a simple solution. anyway, my basic question is how do you get this to run in order: console.log('step 1'); $.getjson('foo.json', function(data) { console.log('step 2'); }); console.log('step 3');  this results in a console output of:  it seems reasonable that something like this might be available which would stall the function until the file has been loaded but it doesn't work.  other threads suggest you can create $.deferred() objects which can chain calls like then().then() before finalizing them somehow but this doesn't help because i actually have functions of this fashions:  other places it was suggested that i could try using $.when() which seemed like a big hassle even if it would work but it didn't when i tried. i tried something like this:  anyway, this seems like it should be really easy but i have no idea how you're supposed to make this work. also, it works perfectly when async is disabled but that is untenable for the website which utilizes this.

22414193	20279485	function inside mouseenter not changing attr. i'm trying to run an attr change inside a mouseenter function. i need to make a new function within the mouseenter function because i eventually need it to callback. i'm starting from the beginning though and it's not functioning on the most basic level right now. in the below example, you'll see that i first iterate through all images. i then take the images file names and change the suffix (that's not really important to this as far as i can tell, i'm just including it so i have everything i'm doing in here just in case). i then run a 'mouseenter' function that will fire on the image element. it logs the new 'src' of the image to the console and then should change the src. it logs the src successfully but doesn't fire the attr function successfully. i've also logged $(this).attr('src') to make sure it's recognizing the image correctly and that works as well. so it knows the current $(this).attr('src') and recognizes the new_img_src variable yet doesn't fire the function. why would that be? like i said, i eventually want to do a callback function which is why this is formatted this way. i will be called img_loop() from within img_loop() once i have all the code set up so i need the img_loop() function to be there as opposed to just using the $(this).attr() function inside mouseenter. thanks for the help!

28053212	23667087	how to ensure that the function doesn't return until mongodb query is complete. i have a user model function all that returns all users in an array.  i want to ensure that the function doesn't finish or return before the mongodb query is complete. currently, this function is just returning [], and querying mongodb asynchronously. i want the function to wait until the function finish query is complete and it returns and array filled with users. note: globallibrary.db is just a cached mongodb connection.  my solution using promises since some people closed the question as a duplicate, i'll write my answer here within the question. hopefully someone else who is not familiar with asynchronous programming find this useful. problem  the point is that you need to use a callback - there's no way to block on something asynchronous. (...) – aaron dufour  the function user.all() i wrote above will return empty array because nothing is stopping the process while the mongodb query is happening. there are some primitive ways to stop the process.  you can crank up some hacky stuff using settimeout(). this way sucks though because you have to use some arbitrary time that might be higher than the actual time you need to query the mongodb. simply put, it's slower. you can also use some event based stuff that @aarondufour linked in the comment (now deleted). so you can have something a pair of event emitter and a listener to replace settimeout() way. @someone points out though that you shouldn't use this in node.js for blocking function. now finally, the conventional way of dealing with this problem is using callbacks as pointed out by the answer below. this is fine, but callbacks can quickly get out of control once you start having multiple callbacks stacked inside one another. i am using https://github.com/kriskowal/q for promises. while using promises doesn't solve all the woes of callbacks, but it looks most like simple synchronous programming style which i think is a huge plus. first do npm install --save q to start using q package. here's my new user.all() function.  now if you want to use user.all().

5927824	23740549	best practice for passing server-side variables to javascript?. i've tried 2 ways that both work but neither feel very clean. the first is to have some inline javascript that accepts the variable from the view template like:  (in my case i'm using jinja2 but same thing would apply to django templates, razor in .net mvc3, twig in php or any number of view templating engines).  obviously the unclean part about this that there's javascript in the html page rather than in a separate file. the other option i've used is to have a hidden field populated server side and then consumed on the javascript end. that feels slightly more clean, but not completely and it's also a bit cumbersome to write. is there a better solution or are those pretty much my only options? p.s. i'm aware of json and in fact i do sometimes have to resort to the first solution if i need to pass something other than primitives. so bonus points for a solution that supports passing json objects without having javascript on the page.

22892681	28250697	what patterns are there for passing state through a chain of promises in javascript?. i'm trying to learn a little about node and asynchronous programming. i read about promises and have made an attempt at using them in a small project that copies posts for a user from service a to service b. i am having some trouble understanding how best to pass state between promises the project is written for nodejs using the promise library a simple definition of my current problem is:  copy posts for a user from service a to service b if the posts don't already exist in service b. both services offer http apis that requires a non-memorable user id to look up posts for that user so user id must be looked up from the user name. all of the http calls are asynchronous.  this is some pseudo code that illustrates how i have chained the promises together.  there are a couple of things that i have thought about doing:  bring the getidforusername call inside the getpostsforuserid function. however, i wanted to keep each unit of functionality as simple as possible along the principle of 'do one thing and do it well'. create a 'context' object and pass it through the whole chain, reading and storing state in this object. however this approach makes each function very bespoke to a chain and therefore difficult to use in isolation.  are there any other options, and what approach is recommended?

25659328	28250697	pass value in promise chain to subsequent handlers. consider this code:  note that both sendmessage*() functions accept socket as a parameter. but only first one will get this, because only the first one will get the resolved value from opensocket(). i can go around this by using a variable in the outer scope, i.e. assign the socket once it's resolved, and then use it in sendmessage2(), but it seems a bit hacky and dirty. also, i know i can use some library support, like described in this answer regarding q. i'm looking for a canonical way of designing this code, which:  would not require any variables in outer scope would not rely on 3rd party promise libraries (should be based on es6 promises)  is there some way to accomplish that? or would that be better to refactor my code to make it easier?

26902994	28250697	promise chaining: use result from previous promise in next then callback. i'm using straight es6 promises (with the es6-promise polyfill library) and i'm running into a problem with accessing results from previous promises in chained ones. this problem is identical in the context of angular/q, but i'm dissatisfied with the answer and wanted to see if there's a better way: how to access result from the previous promise in angularjs promise chain? consider the code snippet below:  in the chained promise, i want to use the student object that i got in the first promise. but as written, this can't access it. i have a couple apparent options:  store the student in a variable in an outer scope (yuck) i actually don't know how this would work, but the solutions in the other question suggest i can call then on the result of helprequest.findbystudent() and promise.resolve the combined result inside the student.find().then call. the below implementation won't work i think, though.   i absolutely don't want to do the processing of the helprequest nested inside of the student.find() method, as that defeats the purpose of chaining promises; and even if the second example can be worked into a usable state, it still feels like a hack. is there a better way to do achieve this without having to introduce global state or nesting into my code? for instance, is there a way to call promise.resolve() on multiple values, some of which may be promises and some of which are not? i'm curious, hope i have alternatives/can understand how to make this work properly without introducing nesting or state!
